    <p>This project is focused on creating a machine learning algorithm to predict the adjusted closing price of specific stocks.  To do this, we used large data sets that date from 1990 to 2020 and added as many relavent features as possible to get the best results that we could.  However, when making a prediction model, the initial accuracy reading is relative to only the data collected.  This of course means that if the data collected is inaccurate or unneeded, the results may be misleading, which means only time can tell the accuracy.  Keep in mind the stock market is very volatile.  National and international events, such as COVID-19, can have drastic effects that even the best models could not predict.</p>
     <style>
    p {
      margin-right: 150px;
      margin-left: 150px;
      text-align: left;

    }
    pre{

<p>The first step in machine learning is collecting and cleaning data to feed into the model.  The more data collected, the more accurate the results, provided the data is relavent.  This can be tricky as it's not always obvious what data will help improve your results.  With this in mind, we chose around twenty features for our data set and the data ranges over 30 years.  We decided this was an appropriate amount of data and a reasonable time frame to work with.</p>
    <p>The next step is creating a model that will give the desired results.  Our model was created to predict results and hopefully give us insight as to what will happen to adjusted closing prices in upcoming quarters.  </P>
      <p>Finally, the results must be read and code must be adjusted to achive an accurate result.  Machine learning is not a once and done type of process.  It can be tedious and time consuming but the product is well worth it.  Machine learning is a very powerful tool and this project is an example of what can be done with a little know how. <br><br><br><br>This project was completed using a variety of libraries. They include; Pandas, MatPlotLib, Numpy, Sci-Kit Learn, Keras, and Tensorflow.  The code for the machine learning was written in Python and the website was made using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.  The data was obtained from <a href='https://financialmodelingprep.com/developer' target='_blank'>Financial Modeling Prep</a>.</p>
